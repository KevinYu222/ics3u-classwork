Functional Decomposition

Vending machine from a human perspective
-------------------------------------------

You get a bag of chips from a vending machine
    - Approach machine.
        - Wal until you are within arm reach.
    - Determine the number for the bag I want.
        - Search for secific flavour
        - Look just below it for the ID number. (Remember that number)
    - Put in correct amount of money.
        - Look beside the number for the cost of the snack.
        - Get out some money greater of equal to that amount.
        - Place that money into the intake.
    - Key in the number for the flavour.
    - Get bag form bottom of machine.
        - Bend down
        - Put arm through slot
        - Grab chips
        - Pull your arm out (with the chips)

Vending machine functional decomposition from a machine perspective
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting a bag of chips out of the machine
    - Get the number for the bag of chips sending out
        - receive input from the button pressed by the costumer
        - match the input number with the proper roll
    - Receive money input from the customer
        - if the money is received from the paper money slot
            - take in the paper money
            - determine if the money is valid
            - if the money is valid
                - determine the amount of money from the size of the paper money
                - Store the amount of money
            - if the money is invalid
                - sent the money out of the slot
        - if the money is received from the coin slot
            - take in the coin
            - determine if the coin is proper
            - if the coin is valid
                - determine the amount of money based on the size of the coins
                - Store the amount of money
            - if the coin is invalid
                - send coin back to the returning slot
        - Check if the money required from that roll of chips is less or equal than the money stored
        - if it is
            - Check if the roll is empty with mechanical pusher
                - If the roll is empty
                    - Ask costumer to select new number
                - If the roll is not empty
                    - Push out the bag of chips
        - if it isn't
            - Wait for more money to insert
        - Repeat process until user choose to return money
            - Return paper money through Paper slot
            - Return coin through coin slot
    - Send out the chips
        - Open the lower slot for the costumer to reach the chips
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identify where there might be basic programming concepts in your break-down above
- A basic command
    - button pressed for the number of the chips
    - pushing the corresponding chips out
    - receiving the money
- Conditional Branching
    - Check if the money is valid and different condition based on if the money is valid
    - Whether send out the chips based on the condition of money and chips.
- loop
    - Match the number inputed with the correct chip in sequence
    - Check the money stored with the money required in sequence
- Nested sequence
    - The conditional branching within the loop for the machine to only give out chips if there are enough money stored

The cookie is too big for the glass
    How do you fix this problem?
        - Break the cookie apart
            - pull the cookie out of the glass
            - hold opposite sides of the cookie
            - use hands to take apart the cookie
        - Put the smaller pieces into the glass of milk one by one
    How can you prevent this problem?
        - Pull more milk into the glasses so the cookie can reach it.
        - Find glass with wider opening than the width of the cookie
        - Get smaller cookies for the glass of milk
        - Split cookies into smaller chunks
    How can this problem be solved with an app?
        - A scanner app that intake the width of the cookie
        - Intake the width of the glass opening
        - If the width of the cookie is more or equal to the width of the glass:
            - Break cookie apart
        - Else
            - Good to go

The spoon dropped into the gravy
    How do you fix this problem?
        - Pick out the spoon from the gravy.
        - Clean the spoon
    How can you prevent this problem?
        - Put the spoon on the side instead of in the gravy.
    How can this problem be solved with a robotic system?
        - Robotic bowl that hold the spoon.
        - If gravy reach a certain level
        - Raise the spoon out of the gravy bowl
